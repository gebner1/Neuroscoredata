## Load packages and data

```{r load-packages, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) 
library(datasauRus)
```
## This is the code for the filtered sham and trauma data and the data is pivoted
```{r}
NSR <- read_csv(file = "data/NSR.csv")

NSR <- NSR %>% mutate(`BOP (psi)` = replace(`BOP (psi)`,`BOP (psi)` == 'x','X'))

NSR <- NSR %>% mutate(`BOP (psi)` = replace(`BOP (psi)`, is.na(`BOP (psi)`),'T'))

longerNSR <- pivot_longer(NSR, names_to = "time_point" , 
             values_to = "score",
             cols = c(3:7))

sham <- longerNSR %>% 
  filter(`BOP (psi)` == "X" | `BOP (psi)` == "x")
trauma <- longerNSR %>%
  filter(is.na(`BOP (psi)`))
sham
trauma

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
